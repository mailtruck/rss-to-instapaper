			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>When you lose confidence in yourself, the worst thing you can do is sit and wait for it to be restored. It won&#8217;t happen. You&#8217;ll feel worse. </p>
<p>Yet this is what we do; we despair because things aren&#8217;t going like we hoped. We feel down because of a &#8216;string of bad luck&#8217; or fall prey to the insidious discouragement that comes along with &#8216;nothing good happening for a while.&#8217;</p>
<p>At the end John Fante&#8217;s book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0876855281/streamjackieg-20">Dreams From Bunker Hill</a></em>, the character, a writer, reminds himself that if he can write one great line, he can write two and if he can write two he can write three, and if he can write three, he can write forever. He pauses. Even that seemed insurmountable. So he types out four lines from one of his favorite poems. <em>What the hell</em>, he says, <em>a man has to start someplace</em>. </p>
<p>When explaining self-esteem to their patients, psychologists use the metaphor of two open cisterns that provide drinking water for nearby towns. When it rains, they both fill to the brim. But when it stops raining, one drains faster than the other. Why does one stay full while the other empties? It&#8217;s simple: it&#8217;s also fed by an underground spring.</p>
<p>We must find our own spring. And return to it when we need replenishment.</p>
<p>We can run a few miles as fast as we&#8217;re able. We can get absorbed in a book, so much that you forget the world around you. Or help someone. Have stimulating conversation. Go for a long walk. These things tap into something bigger than us and in the process remind us about that which is within us—what we are capable of. We simply need to seek it out. </p>
<p>The professional, Steve Pressfield writes in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446691437/streamjackieg-20">The War of Art</a></em>, sometimes has to &#8220;throw down a 360 tomahawk jam from time to time, just to let the boys know he&#8217;s still in business.&#8221; The boys in this case are those little doubts you get in your head, the ones that tell you that you don&#8217;t have what it takes, that the project isn&#8217;t worth it, that you&#8217;re not up to the task. Go out and remind the crowd why you&#8217;re in the arena. Do what you have within you but take for granted or are saving for later. Silence them by doing it. Remind yourself. </p>
<p>A common theme from the ancients is that of great, supernatural forces. A swirl of particles. Time as a river. Flowing energy. Incarnation. It might have stemmed from their ignorance of certain scientific concepts, but that was a benefit rather than a curse. This makes it easier to imagine tapping into something <em>out there</em>, finding nourishment in it, being moved forward from it. These were streams that they could depend on, infinite underground wells to fill their cisterns.</p>
<p>As I struggle with confidence in my own life and on my own projects, it&#8217;s helpful to think of this. It is replenishing, a little bit more each time. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>There is this feeling you get when you&#8217;re driving a friend&#8217;s car or staying in a hotel. It is less stressful, easier. All the things and baggage you&#8217;ve allowed to accumulate in your actual life don&#8217;t seem to be there. You don&#8217;t look at the gas gauge and care. The things that bother you about your car don&#8217;t bother you in this one. You sleep better in the hotel. It feels nicer than your house. </p>
<p>If it could always be like this, you think, <em>that would be the life</em>. Which is funny because nothing is actually different. Unless you&#8217;re an asshole, you&#8217;re still paying for gas. Hotel rooms are actually filthy and you could buy all the stuff in them for your own house if you wanted. Yet it doesn&#8217;t feel the same. </p>
<p>This is because you&#8217;ve given yourself, as Marcus Aurelius would say, &#8220;the gift of the present moment.&#8221; It feels fresh because you are looking at it fresh. You appreciate your feelings because you&#8217;re aware of them, you&#8217;re alert for a change. Like you&#8217;ve taken a big deep breath and opened your eyes.</p>
<p>These glimpses are helpful because they remind us what we could have if we just got out of our own way. If we stopped minding the gas tank and caring whether it cost $3.59 or $4 a gallon to fill up. If we remember that we can move or, more realistically, rearrange the inside of our own house whenever we get tired of it. If a certain kind of blanket feels better, get it and be done with the issue. They remind us that all the things we say weigh us down are ours by choice.</p>
<p>Sometimes a quick shift in our environment forces us to focus entirely on the present&#8211;it doesn&#8217;t allow us to muddle up the situation with our thoughts and pessimism and worry. And the instant of lightness we feel when it happens, well, that&#8217;s what we could have all the time if we wanted to and worked at it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>There is much to be learned from pain. Especially physical pain. I would never say it warrants being sought out or needlessly extended but there is always a lesson in it. It makes for a good metaphor. And <a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/metaphors-philosophy/">metaphors are the key to understanding the world</a>, as well as ourselves.  </p>
<p>I fractured my elbow recently in a fall from a bike. I got up to try to shake it off. <em>Stay with it</em>, I told myself as I made my way to the gym to clean up. <em>Do you want you need to do in spite of it</em>.  The value of physical pain is that it is finite. It ends when the ailment ends. We can use this as an opportunity to <em>push on through</em>, with the safety net of knowing it will eventually be over. It is practice. </p>
<p>For every physical pain or ailment, there are a hundred emotional and metaphysical pains. Not just pains but conditions: anxiety, discomfort, fear, uncertainty, and failure. We may be scared to acknowledge these or have no faith that we can bear them. Our injuries, our broken bones, aches, flus, migraines, and diseases—the distresses that come, are dealt with in time and then go (thought they occasionally leave a lasting trail), they are proof that we have what it takes to reach inside and deal with the others. </p>
<p>When you run and you get a blister. It hurts like hell for a minute—gets hot and pulsates, like an ember caught between the sock and the foot. If you&#8217;ve ever pushed through it, what happens is disgusting but wonderful at the same time. The skin bursts and the puss floods out, the body&#8217;s way of putting out the fire. The body, we forget, has all sorts of mechanisms designed to numb and treat pain. And so suddenly, it doesn&#8217;t hurt anymore.</p>
<p>Pain is a lesson in fortitude and also in self-awareness. In knowing our limits and our vulnerabilities. In a way it is a reminder that we are alive. Small or big, it prickles our senses and wakes them up—brings us back into the present, pulls us from our thoughts and to the physical. In many cases, it is a message that we are not in control. </p>
<p>What surprised me with my arm was that there was little sharp pain—sharp pain is easy to know what to do with. Take a pill. Clean a wound. See a doctor. But dull pain, dull pain is harder. We&#8217;re not as sure where to place it. Do we ignore and hope it will go away? Its what I did. All I felt was heaviness. Right up through the x-ray a few days later, I was sure it was nothing. Then it rose up and hit me in the room: <em>I&#8217;m going to faint</em>. <em>I&#8217;m going to pass out right here from the pain in the middle of it all</em> and promptly did.</p>
<p>We are not in control of pain. No matter how hard we try. Not of the cause or the duration—only the response. Through it we are given an opportunity to act our principles: justice, kindness, selflessness, moderation, self-direction. It offers the reminder that though pain is inevitable, suffering is not. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny because many of the toughest people shrink from facing these issues. Or are easily knocked around by it. They forget to <em>stay with it</em>, to push through, to do what they need to do in spite of it. Yet they face and endure the most trying physical calamities on a constant basis. This is to refuse to learn the lessons of pain. A failure to see what a calming, reassuring metaphor it is. </p>

A few words about this one. I don&#8217;t do the standard blog stuff. I use the second person a lot. You like that. I try to talk about the things that I wish blogs would talk about more often: life, dealing with assholes, how to be self-critical and self-aware, humility, philosophy, reading and strategy. And by those things I mean those things in a thoughtful and practical way, not seo-bait and bulleted list stuff. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>I have always felt pulled in two conflicting directions. It has not been pleasant. It&#8217;s made me feel miserable when I should feel happy, afraid when I should feel secure&#8211;a sort of constant tension and uncertainty that takes an exhausting toll.</p>
<p>There is the part of me drawn to discipline. To work and do great things in this brief bit of time I have been given. It is the force that keeps my nose in books and rarely allows my mind to waste a second. You could say that this is the part of me that people see and assume I am much older than I actually am, as they often have and do. This is the reason I&#8217;ve done the things I&#8217;ve been able to do while the rest of my generation is unemployed or deluding themselves. It is the side I indulge most. </p>
<p>There is another part of me pulled towards recklessness. To simply live. To hate the things that most people seem to value. To not want to be anything like them, to barely give a shit about what I&#8217;ve done and where I&#8217;ve been so far. To so seriously consider trading it in to do nothing ever again that it makes me want to cry. This is an urge that I do not understand.</p>
<p>I fear I won&#8217;t ever be able to. When I try to explore it, to see why I am drawn towards these things, the other side takes over.  The few moves I&#8217;ve made in my life that could be considered daring or even reckless&#8211;dropping out of school, packing up and moving across the country&#8211;were almost immediately overwhelmed by the responsible side. The pureness and freedom almost instantly corrupted by the instinct to &#8216;turn it into to something.&#8217;</p>
<p>I remember once on this site feeling like I could write and write whatever I wanted, that there was no idea end to what I had to say. Slowly, certain self-applied standards began to encroach stylistically. No, that&#8217;s not good enough. Or no, that&#8217;s not the type of stuff I want to here. What felt like rigor was actually the gradual removal of options, to the point of partial paralysis.</p>
<p>And so it goes. Running becomes something that must be done every day. Books must be read. Contacts must be kept. Friendships must be turned into business relationships. Everything must be made into an opportunity, because opportunities can be turned into something. An opportunity to&#8230;</p>
<p>All this is to say that there is a tension in me that I have trouble grappling with. It is the feeling of living in a house divided against itself. Worse, given the irony of the disagreement being rooted in the same philosophic principals: to value only what is important, self-direction and freedom. And yet I think they are both equal parts fear, the fear of simply <em>just being</em>. </p>
<p>I do not know the solution here, or the answer. This is not meant to be advice. The person who watches as one side of them strangles the other, shunting it off to the side where its only remaining role is to impotently undermine their earnest accomplishments should not be giving advice. I only know that this is no way to live. Finding the balance here&#8211;easing the tension&#8211;will be the next steps for me. It will make my next moves clear. And between now and then will not be fun.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Yesterday, I forgot what day of the week it was. Not the standard <em>&#8220;hey, man what&#8217;s the date?&#8221;</em> small talk we say without thinking, but truly and completely mistook one day for another. I&#8217;d been engrossed in my writing and in my work and lost track where I was in the week.</p>
<p>It must be Tuesday, I thought, I spent all day working yesterday. In my mind, I&#8217;d become so used to the arbitrary distinction between the week and the weekend that it seemed like a natural law. The fact that one meant being in an office and the other usually didn&#8217;t was like an subconscious compass. But now, it&#8217;s not true anymore. </p>
<p>One day. All days. The same. To wake up, do my work, on myself and by myself, and nevermind the details. It was a feeling I hadn&#8217;t had since I was a kid, when breaks from school would run longer than my memory could go in either direction. </p>
<p>Remember, people who <a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/motivation/">love what they do</a> wear themselves out doing it. <em>They forget to even wash and sleep</em>. There is a reason, I think, that I immediately recalled something to my childhood when I realized I&#8217;d done this. To be consumed with work&#8211;pleasurable work&#8211;and curiosity and almost nothing else is to revert back to a natural state. </p>
<p>From this naturalness comes happiness. Because happiness, as the philosophers say, exists solely in the present, results from discipline, and manifests itself in excellence. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>At 20, I moved to Los Angeles to live with Tucker Max for the summer. I didn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/like-sand-through-the-hourglass/">know it then</a>, but I was dropping out of school and I would never come back. At 24, I&#8217;m dropping out again. Last week I packed up what little I still own and moved to New Orleans. </p>
<p>When I did it the first time, I was scared. Scared all the time. It&#8217;s funny because I was worried every day I had my job for the last year. <em>Is this who I am going to become?  What am I supposed to do with all this?</em> And when I left, actually the second I made the announcement I was leaving, all the fear left. As soon as I was given control of my life back, I felt calm and comfortable. At peace. It was a nice bookend to realize this, to realize that fear I felt both times was rooted in a single theme: <a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/its-just-life/">taking control of my life</a>. Leaving school, that was taking it. Leaving a career, that was acknowledging that I&#8217;d given too much of it back. </p>
<p>But this was always my plan. When I made it, I thought it&#8217;d take two years; it took closer to three. In the middle of those two events, I&#8217;ve racked up more than I ever would have expected. I was the Director of Marketing at American Apparel. I researched for a bestselling book by Robert Greene and 50 Cent. I&#8217;ve advised on the release of five of them now. I&#8217;ve bought millions of dollars <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/american-apparel-grabs-youtubes-long-tail-101150">in advertising</a>. I&#8217;ve seen my work written about in every major publication I can think of. I&#8217;ve been offered two book opportunities and turned them down. I ran one of the biggest and earlier Groupon deals. I&#8217;ve traveled. Met with important people. Been humiliated and learned from mistakes. Had power, used power, observed powered. And at the end of it, all I could think was: so&#8230;</p>
<p>The middle had its ups, no question. I&#8217;m beyond grateful to the people who allowed me to take a shot at them. But it was grueling. Shakespeare once wrote that &#8220;between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion, all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream.&#8221; It was something I <a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/one-of-them/">struggled</a> <a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/the-dress-suit-bribe/">to appreciate</a> for a <a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/catharsis/">long time</a>, trying not to lose control of the wheel and veer off in a direction I didn&#8217;t want to go. To trust in the plan, to accept the commitment. Some people are meant for a certain kind of life. Some are not. It&#8217;s important to know where you fall in that. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not talked about these things on this site for a  few reasons. Mostly because I was busy actually doing them. The other reason was I didn&#8217;t want to be like <a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/is-this-who-you-want-to-be/">the rest of the charlatans out there</a>. I wanted to build up something solid before I talked about myself and my opinions. I just couldn&#8217;t see what I&#8217;d get out of doing it before that, except feeling like a douche. But now you have it, there I am and &#8216;<a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/about/">what I do.</a>&#8216; </p>
<p>What&#8217;s next for me is a book. I&#8217;ve already begun working on it. Some of the ideas of already been floating around on here in posts (see: <a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/the-use-of-abandoned-shells/">this</a> and <a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/the-worst-thing-about-blogs/">this</a>) but it is mostly new material and not what you&#8217;d expect of me. This is not the book I&#8217;ve dreamed of writing but is the book I HAVE to write now. If I do it right, it will open the door for the former as well.</p>
<p>Anyway, here I am at 24. Not close to the millionaire I naively promised myself years ago I&#8217;d be by the time I was 25. But I do have more than I know what to do with. And thanks to <a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/post_49/">Philosophy</a> I can&#8217;t see myself realistically chasing that goal very hard anymore. Because when you figure out what is important to you in life, you can throw out all the rest. You can stop chasing ghost and shadows and illusions. You can lean on what is real and what is necessary. And you can laugh and pity those can&#8217;t. You can realize, as Seneca wrote, that too often they &#8216;win&#8217; at the cost of life.</p>
<p>And so you focus on yourself and what you need to do. And block out all the rest. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>You know that feeling you get when you haven&#8217;t been to the gym in a few days? A bit doughy. Irritable. Claustrophobic. Uncertain.</p>
<p>That is how people who don&#8217;t fulfill their potential feel on a daily basis. Only the cause and effect is obscured. It&#8217;s sublimated beneath general anxieties about money, about their status, about bullshit office politics and ego. They mask it in depression or other manifestations of pain—back injuries, carpal tunnel, that bad knee that is always acting up. But deep down it&#8217;s stress from the cage, the position the human animal isn&#8217;t built to know how to tolerate.</p>
<p>And so they try to find a cure without knowing the disease. Buying themselves things, going out, fucking, careers, vacations, divorces and new loves. The cycle is so vicious precisely because these things don&#8217;t have any affect. The person only feels worse about themselves, like it&#8217;s their fault the medicine doesn&#8217;t seem to take.</p>
<p>The solution is simple and doesn&#8217;t really need to be said. To keep with the metaphor though, it&#8217;s only possible when you realize the reason you feel like shit is because you gorged yourself the day before and haven&#8217;t exercised. Then you know that all you have to do is get off your ass and go work out. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Think about how easy it is to have one more—to go beyond what you allowed yourself and have one more piece, one more glass, one more handful. And yet, think about how much harder it is to <em>do</em> one more—one more lap, one more page, one more hour, one more rep than you intended. There&#8217;s always rationalization on hand for the one and an convenient excuse ready for the other.</p>
<p>The person who can conquer these two dilemmas and reverse the order of this seemingly inalterable paradox, they are a true master of themselves. They have achieved more than self-control. They have <em>self-direction</em>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>I&#8217;ve learned recently that its better to tell people that I <em>might</em> do something or that <em> maybe </em> I will be going to this. You get better feedback this way. Rather, you  actually get feedback this way because it creates an opening for it. People are reluctant to speak their feelings when its clear that you&#8217;ve made up your mind already. </p>
<p>It calls to mind a remark by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9780306805073/streamjackieg-20">William Tecumsah Sherman</a>, who once told a friend he never gave reasons for what he thought until he absolutely had to. Because after a while, a new and better reason would pop into his head and he&#8217;d want to use that instead. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s what Polonius told Laertes in Hamlet. Keep your thoughts to yourself, he said, and <em>&#8220;take each man&#8217;s censure but reserve thy judgement.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Part of <a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/strong-opinions-loosely-held/">strong opinions, loosely held</a> is side-stepping <a href="http://www.ryanholiday.net/a-false-sense/">the tendency to reify</a>. There is no need to amplify your intentions by repeating them as certainties. By wording things as contingencies, I feel that I am to make room for change based on the facts as they come. To set things up literally as only possibilities, but mentally as assumptions. Function follows form, as some say, and this is the proper form.</p>
<p>What this means presenting externally the signs of ambivalence, while beneath, know firmly what you intend to do and how you intend to do it. Because, with the exception of special circumstances, people who seem sure of themselves and their future are threatening. On the outside, be like everyone else: indolent and unsure and drifting. On the inside: none of these things. </p>
